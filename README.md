# Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

## Objective
This project analyzes a real-world employee dataset to uncover trends in performance and attrition. It leverages statistical techniques, machine learning, and neural network models to make predictions and provide actionable HR recommendations.

---

##  Project Structure

- **Phase 1 – Data Collection & EDA**
  - Loaded and cleaned `Employee_data.csv`.
  - Handled missing values and encoded categorical columns.
  - Performed descriptive statistics and visualized feature relationships.

- **Phase 2 – Predictive Modeling**
  - **Attrition Prediction** using Random Forest and MLPClassifier.
  - **Performance Prediction** using Linear Regression and MLPRegressor.

- **Phase 3 – Deep Learning**
  - Used Scikit-learn's MLP models as neural network alternatives (no TensorFlow).
  - Trained models with scaled input features and evaluated using R² and F1-score.

- **Phase 4 – Reporting & Insights**
  - Identified key drivers of attrition and performance.
  - Provided recommendations for employee retention and department-wise improvements.
  - Created visualizations such as line plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

## Key Insights

- **Departments with high attrition**: Support, Sales.
- **Low performers** are more likely to leave.
- **High salary and tenure** correlate positively with performance.

---

##  Recommendations

- Implement department-specific training and mentorship programs.
- Retention strategy for 1–2 year tenure employees.
- Introduce performance-linked recognition and bonuses.

---

##  Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (RandomForest, MLP)
- Jupyter Notebook
